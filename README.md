# 🏄‍♂ Who am I?

My name is Darshan Makwana, I am a third year UG student at IIT Bombay. My interests range from origami to machine learning. I try to apply Bellman Equations for the optimization of my life, which is a Markov decision process, but the future discount factor in the equation might be small and you will often find me trapped in local optimums
